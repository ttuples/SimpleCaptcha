## Disclaimer

This mod is intended for **joke purposes only** and should not be used as a security measure. It is designed to add a fun and non-disruptive challenge for players, not to protect servers from bots or unauthorized access.

The mod was inspired by a video I saw on the SDMP server, I couldnâ€™t find the mod so I assumed it was custom made and wanted to have it on my server so I recreated it.

The sounds were taken from [The Graveyard](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-graveyard-fabric) Mod because idk where to get good sounds like that, if the owner would like me to remove please let me know.
## Features

- **Captcha Challenge:** Pops up a captcha challenge that must be solved to continue. These captchas are meant to be fun and slightly challenging, ensuring a humorous interruption in gameplay.

## Commands

SimpleCaptcha introduces two primary commands to control when and to whom captchas appear:

- `/captcha`: Triggers a captcha challenge for the player executing the command. Ideal for self-induced pranks.

- `/captcha [player]`: Triggers a captcha challenge to the specified player. This allows for an element of surprise to other players' gameplay.

## Installation

To install SimpleCaptcha, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the SimpleCaptcha mod file from the releases section.
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your Minecraft's `mods` folder.
3. Ensure you are running a compatible version of Minecraft with the Fabric mod loader installed.
4. Start your Minecraft client or server to see if the mod is loaded and ready for some prank action.

## Usage

### Initiating a Self-Challenge

To initiate a captcha challenge for yourself, type the following command in the game's chat:

```/captcha```

### Sending a Challenge to Another Player

To send a captcha challenge to another player, use the command with their username:

```/captcha username```

Replace `username` with the actual player's name to surprise them with a captcha challenge.
